# CYCLOPSarchive

This repository is used to store previous versions of CYCLOPS (Cyclic Ordering by Periodic Structure), which is a tool designed to reconstruct the temporal ordering of high dimensional that is generated by a common periodic process. Descriptions of the CYCLOPS approach can be found online at [PNAS](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/04/19/1619320114.full).

Please visit [CYCLOPS](https://github.com/ranafi/CYCLOPS) to try the newest version of CYCLOPS.
